             Pyrene is one of the most frequently used lipid-linked fluorophores. Its most characteristic features are a long
             excited state lifetime and (local) concentration-dependent formation of excimers. Pyrene is also hydrophobic and thus
            does not significantly distort the conformation of the labeled lipid molecule. These characteristics make pyrene lipids
well-suited for studies on a variety of biophysical phenomena like lateral diffusion, inter- or transbilayer movement
of lipids and lateral organization of membranes. Pyrene lipids have also been widely employed to determine protein
binding to membranes, lipid conformation and the activity of lipolytic enzymes. In cell biology, pyrene lipids are
promising tools for studies on lipid trafficking and metabolism, as well as for microscopic mapping of membrane
properties. The main disadvantage of pyrene lipids is the relatively large size of the fluorophore. Another
disadvantage is that they require UV-excitation, which is not feasible with all microscopes. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science
